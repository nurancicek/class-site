        <h1>Reading Responses</h1>
        <h2>My Website is a Shifting House…</h2>
        <p>The author mentions that the author of the website “create not only works (the “objects”) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!).” I used templates to create my current portfolio website, and there is something limited to that. Template creator is another artist, and I believe that creates a slight disconnection between my work and the overall website. It's important to create the world that your works will live in. I liked the idea of treating the website as a plant that can't grow fully overnight and needs time to blossom and develop. Need to be patient and don't rush.</p>
        <h2>A Rant About "Technology"</h2>
        <p>I've always been amazed by the objects around me. Who designs it? How do they create it? Which processes does it goes through to turn into an object that I see? How many factories are there in the world and where are they located? There is a whole system, a bunch of workers, and a factory just to create the button on my shirt. Crazy…</p>
        <h2>A Handmade Web</h2>
        <p>Reading the Handmade Web, I saw a correlation between the web and sweaters. How? Think of a sweater produced by a fast-fashion brand in the factory with cheap non-breathable materials such as polyester or acrylic. The sweater's pattern is based on what's trending at that moment which means it will stay “fashionable” for a short period and wouldn't last more than a season. Now think about a hand-knitted sweater made out of merino wool, cashmere, or alpaca. The style and the pattern are unique because it's based on your style and preference. It might cost you more and takes a long time to finish it. However, you'll end up with a timeless, unique piece that can last a lifetime, and since you are the knitter, you can always go and make adjustments. Like the “'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance” as Carpenter mentions. Do you know how to knit or are you interested in that? I think that's the question to ask.

        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>The connection that the author made between computers and cities was interesting, and I've never thought about this comparison. Using the author's way of thinking, we can say that computers are similar to houses. Every house has a basic structure and plan. They are built with a similar system even though the materials used to differ. It's up to the house owner to decorate and make the house function on their behalf, just like the apps and the software one uses on their computer or how they group their folders. Maybe my point is more about what computers are used for and not how they are built, but you got the point…</p>
        <h2>A Friend is Writing</h2>
        <p>Okay, to be honest, there are a lot of movements going on this website, and it’s really hard for me to focus on the reading and understand it while tiles are popping up on the side constantly while the text is being typed partially and highlighted. The website threw me off after spending several minutes exploring it so I guess my reflection ends here.</p>
