        <p>Here is my first paragraph text for a website.</p>
        <p class="special">The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, <em>but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.</em> This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will <strong>emphasize the hand-quality of websites</strong> by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web. We will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
        <p>Here's a list of some things that I like:</p>

            <li>tea</li>
            <li>shoes</li>
        </ol>
