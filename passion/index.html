        <h1>MY PASSION</h1>
        <h2>Preparing Turkish Breakfast and Tea Every Morning</h2>
        <p>When I was a kid, my mom always prepared breakfast for my siblings and me, even when she had to leave early for school. Thanks to her, having a good healthy breakfast became an irreplaceable part of my daily routine. Good breakfast came with a cup of Turkish tea, and over time, I became a tea addict or <mark><em>tearyaki</em></mark>, which I coined the term. I even remember sipping my nice hot cup of tea at the hospital while waiting for my mom to give birth to my little sister. Anyways, back to the topic. I love preparing a nice breakfast for myself and preparing to others even more. It is my passion. It is my ritual. It is what motivates me to wake up every single morning.</p>
        <p class="special">My morning routine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boil water to brew tea</li>
            <li>Prepare the breakfast plate</li>
            <li>Enjoy the hot tea and breakfast before going about your day</li>
        </ul>
